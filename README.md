# Blog MAUI Design System Library (Library Part 5) Extending Control Behavior with Button

This repository contains the MAUI project featured in this article.

In this article, we enhanced our LabelBase control by adding properties to display an action button with an image (ActionIconSource) and a command (ActionIconCommand). 
This button provides additional interactivity, allowing users to execute business logic with a simple click. 

We also implemented a custom behavior for PickerPopupLabel to display a default icon (chevron_bottom.png) and trigger a popup when the button is clicked, even if no command is specified. 

Lastly, we created a DisplayService to manage popups independently, improving the testability and flexibility of our ViewModel.
