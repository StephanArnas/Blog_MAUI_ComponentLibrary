Upgrading your .NET MAUI application to .NET 9.0 unlocks powerful new features and performance improvements, but it also comes with changes that can introduce technical debt if not addressed promptly.

It is crucial to carefully review and resolve all build warnings, as these often highlight deprecated APIs, obsolete features, or potential issues with compatibility. Ignoring these warnings may lead to larger challenges in future updates as APIs are removed or behaviors change.

By tackling warnings now, you not only ensure a smoother upgrade path for future versions of .NET but also maintain a clean and maintainable codebase. This proactive approach reduces technical debt, improves project stability, and allows your team to focus on building new features rather than firefighting issues.
