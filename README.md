In this article, we enhanced the button component in our MAUI Design System by integrating a Progress Bar with a custom CButton control.
This implementation introduces an IsLoading property for visual feedback and demonstrates the integration of the TaskLoaderCommand for state management.

We also addressed button state handling and explored how to bind properties like ShowLoader for seamless UI updates, creating a responsive and interactive user experience.
